# <ins>Youtube Controller</ins>
This is a program that allows you to control YouTube videos in Google Chrome even when you are using other programs.

### <ins>Installation</ins>

1. Download and install `YoutubeControllerSetup.exe`.  
2. If the program is not already running in your system tray, Run `YoutubeController.exe` from the start menu.
3. Enjoy :]

### <ins>Controls</ins>

Youtube Controller will be always be continuously running in the background. You can pause or exit the program by accessing the icon in your **system tray** on the lower right corner of your screen.

**Pause**: `Ctrl + Space`

**Rewind**: `Alt + Left-Arrow`

**Fastforward**: `Alt + Right-Arrow`

**Fullscreen**: `Alt + F`

**Volume Up**: `Alt + =`  
*(Hold alt and press the equals sign at the top of your keyboard)*

**Volume Down**: `Alt + -`  
*(Hold alt and press the minus sign at the top of your keyboard)*

### <ins>Troubleshooting</ins>
- Should Work perfectly well even with multiple Chrome **tabs** open. If you have multiple actual **windows** of Chrome open, the Chrome window with the Youtube video needs to have been selected more recently than the other Chrome windows without the Youtube video.  
- If there is another tab with the word "Youtube" in the title, the program will run on that tab. To fix this, move your Youtube video to the **left** of that tab.

### <ins>Acknowledgements</ins>
This is a program in development initially based on an AHK script from reddit user GroggyOtter which has been augmented to incorporate more functionality and ease-of-use.
