# <ins>Youtube Controller</ins>
This is a program that allows you to control YouTube videos in Google Chrome when the window is not selected or you are using other programs.

### <ins>Installation</ins>

1. Download and install `Youtube Controller Setup v1.1.exe`.  
2. If the program is not already running in your system tray, Run `Youtube Controller 1.1.exe` from the start menu.
3. Enjoy :]

### <ins>Controls</ins>

Youtube Controller will be always be continuously running in the background. You can pause or exit the program by accessing the icon in your **system tray** on the lower right corner of your screen.

**Pause / Play**: `Ctrl + Space`

**Rewind**: `Alt + Left-Arrow`

**Fastforward**: `Alt + Right-Arrow`

**Fullscreen**: `Alt + F`

**Volume Up**: `Alt + =`  
*(Hold alt and press the equals sign at the top of your keyboard)*

**Volume Down**: `Alt + -`  
*(Hold alt and press the minus sign at the top of your keyboard)*

**Next Video**: `Ctrl + Shift + Alt + Right`  
*(Added in version 1.1)*  

**Previous Video / Previous Page**: `Ctrl + Shift + Alt + Left`  
*(Added in version 1.1)*

### <ins>Troubleshooting</ins>
- Should work perfectly well even with multiple Chrome **tabs** open. If you have multiple actual **windows** of Chrome open, the Chrome window with the Youtube video needs to have been selected more recently than the other Chrome windows without the Youtube video.  
- If you have more than one Youtube tab open, place the tab you want to control to the left of the others. The program will automatically select that tab if another Youtube tab isn't already selected.
- ~~If there is another tab with the word "Youtube" in the title, the program will run on that tab. To fix this, move your Youtube video to the **left** of that tab.~~  
*(Fixed in version 1.1)*

### <ins>Acknowledgements</ins>
This is a program in development initially based on an AHK script from reddit user GroggyOtter which has been augmented to incorporate more functionality and ease-of-use.
